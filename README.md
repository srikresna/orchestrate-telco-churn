# Orchestrate Telco Customer Churn
The objective of this project is to predict when a telco customer is likely to churn by utilizing machine learning algorithms. We employ _TensorFlow Extended_ (TFX) as the pipeline for this project. After building and training the model, we deploy it to a server. To ensure the model is functioning optimally and providing valuable insights, we monitor its performance in real-time using Prometheus and Grafana as our monitoring system.
